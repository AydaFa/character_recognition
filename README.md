## Introduction
This project is a handwritten character recognition system implemented using TensorFlow and EMNIST dataset. It allows you to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits (0-9) and letters (A-Z). You can also test the model's performance by providing input characters and visualizing the model's predictions.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need the following:

- Python version: 3.6+
- TensorFlow version: 2.13.0
- EMNIST dataset (automatically downloaded via the `emnist` Python package)
- Matplotlib for visualizing training history

## Setup
Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in a Python environment with the required dependencies installed.
3. Ensure you have TensorFlow 2.13.0 installed; you can install it using `pip install tensorflow`.
4. Run the Jupyter notebook `handwritten_text_analysis.ipynb` in a compatible environment (e.g., Google Colab) or your local Jupyter setup.

## Training and Usage
The project includes the following key components:

- Data Preparation: The EMNIST dataset is used for training and testing. It is preprocessed and normalized before training.

- Data Augmentation: To improve model robustness, data augmentation techniques such as rotation and shifting are applied to the training data.

- Convolutional Neural Network: The model architecture consists of convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, dropout layers, and fully connected layers.

- Model Training: The model is trained using the training data with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function.

- Visualizing Training: You can visualize the model's training history, including accuracy and loss, using Matplotlib.

- Model Saving and Loading: The trained model can be saved and loaded for future use.

- Character Image Generation: You can generate an image of a handwritten character and test the model's prediction on it.

To use the model for character recognition, simply provide an input character, and the model will predict the corresponding character or digit.
